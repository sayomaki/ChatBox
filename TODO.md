# TODOs for ChatBox

## Text Formatting
Add support for bold(`*`), italic(`_`), and strikethrough(`~`) contained texts.

## Better alignment
Change the absolute position to relative to the text.<br>
Also add more dynamic box size and margin.

Currently using fixed increments and multiples.

## Better code design
Code looks very sloppy at the moment, would want to organise it.

## More customisation and ease of use
Allow the users to change color of box.<br>
Able to change some variables.
